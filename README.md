Hello,

In this post, I explained the use of SOLID Principles in the PLC world by refactoring the code through a software I used to write.

I especially wanted to draw attention to how important and useful the architecture and principles used in the software world are in automation software and the quality they add to the codes we write.
With the increasing number of companies and products that support Object Oriented Programming in today's automation technologies, this issue has become more valuable globally and will continue to rise.
